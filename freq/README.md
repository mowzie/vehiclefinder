  starting analyzing frequency sample size based on "yelp"
  toyed with overlap, this seems to help in detecting frequencies at the cost of additional CPU power
  FFT's generally have some level of overlap in the window.
  Will test different sample sizes with different size overlap (most likely in the range of: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16)
